# sand-table

I'd like to make my own sand drawing table.

Main desired features:
G-code driven
hand-wheel drive as well


The initial drive idea is similar to the Maslow CNC, which is cable-driven polar
robot with two stepper motors.  Instead of using weights, I'll use constant-
force springs to keep the main carriage taut and driving.  The carriage will be
under the sand table, and moving a neodidlium magnet to drag a steel ball bearing
around.


I'd like it to be usable as a table, but also interactive - the easy way is a
handheld magnet puck that can steal the ball bearing and be used to draw directly;
also would like some direct-input hand wheels, and the ability to load new
drawings easily.  A good end-goal would be a self-hosted website where random
photos could be dropped, traced, parsed to gcode and drawn.


Most parts will be 3D printed.

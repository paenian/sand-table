|                          Important bugfixes                          |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

  • GUI: Window position/size was often wrong on startup and when opening new
    documents
    (Bugs #1190828, #1654464, #195683, #568867)
  • Symbols: Fix loading of Visio Stencils from .vss files with special
    characters in file name
    (Bug #1662465)
  • SVG import/export: Special characters in the document's "title" field could
    result in invalid SVG output and prevent re-opening the file on Windows
    (Bugs #576126, #1627551)
  • EMF/WMF import/export: Fix many issues that occurred when the system's
    locale was set to a language using comma (,) as decimal separator. Notably
    text was often positioned wrongly after import (Bugs #1089857, #1335660, #
    1599763, #1675755) and the export option "Convert gradients to colored
    polygons series" made Inkscape crash (Bug #1549015)
  • LaTeX+PDF export: Fix export for text inside a masked or clipped group.
    (Bug #1417470)
  • Extensions: The attribute xml:space="preserve" for INX Parameters of type
    description was ignored but they were untranslatable without it (Bug #
    1668115). The attribute is now respected and translations work properly in
    all cases, however please note that this might change formatting in cases
    that were broken before, i.e. whenever omitting the attribute. To maintain
    visual appearance please add the attribute.
  • Import: Fix many issues with importing large files. Many files that could
    not be opened before (especially those containing large raster graphics)
    should import fine now.
    (Bugs #1572280, #1412912, #1373322, #1243011, #1627004, #1687090)
  • Fonts: Do not load fonts with illegal characters in font family name which
    caused a crash.
    (Bugs #1508928, #1495386)
  • Inkview: Fix loading files with non-ASCII characters in filename
    (Bug #488997)
  • Shortcuts
    - Fix "Shift" modifier being added incorrectly for many user defined
      shortcuts (making them unusable)
    - Allow to set shortcuts with characters that need to be escaped (e.g. "&
      ", "<", ">")
    - Fix crash when exporting user defined shortcuts on Windows
      (Bug #1639701)
    - Improved performance of shortcut list in preferences

  • Fill and Stroke: Fix HSL color selector sometimes showing corrupted colors
    with a non-functioning 5th slider
    (Bug #1635982)
  • Fix occasional crash closing or saving on Windows 7
